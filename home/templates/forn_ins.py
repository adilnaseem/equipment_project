Displaying ManyToManyField Titles in Django Forms

When working with ManyToManyFields in Django forms, the default representation is often a checkbox or select multiple field. 1  However, you might want to display the titles of the related objects in a more user-friendly way. Here are some approaches to achieve this: Â

Creating forms from models - Django documentation

1. Using a ModelMultipleChoiceField:

If you want to display the titles of the related objects in a more readable format, you can use a ModelMultipleChoiceField. This field allows you to specify a custom to_str_field argument to determine which field to display.

Python

from django import forms
from your_app.models import YourModel, RelatedModel

class YourForm(forms.ModelForm):
    related_field = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(
        queryset=RelatedModel.objects.all(),
        to_str_field='title'  # Display the 'title' field of the related model
    )

    class Meta:
        model = YourModel
        fields = '__all__'
2. Customizing the Template:

If you want more control over the rendering, you can customize the template. You can iterate over the selected items and display their titles:

HTML

{% for selected_item in form.related_field.value %}
    <li>{{ selected_item.title }}</li>
{% endfor %}
3. Using a Custom Widget:

For more complex scenarios, you can create a custom widget to control the rendering of the ManyToManyField. This allows you to customize the appearance and behavior of the field.

Python

from django.forms import widgets

class CustomManyToManyWidget(widgets.SelectMultiple):
    # ... custom widget logic ...

class YourForm(forms.ModelForm):
    related_field = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(
        queryset=RelatedModel.objects.all(),
        widget=CustomManyToManyWidget
    )
Choosing the Right Approach:

The best approach depends on your specific needs:

If you want a simple, out-of-the-box solution, using ModelMultipleChoiceField with to_str_field is a good choice.
If you need more customization, creating a custom widget provides greater flexibility.
If you want a more user-friendly interface, consider using a JavaScript-based solution like a tag input field.
By carefully considering these options and tailoring them to your specific requirements, you can effectively display ManyToManyField titles in your Django forms.
